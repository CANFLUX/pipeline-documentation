## Motivation: The Importance of Flux Data Standardization and Reproducibility

[XXX Intro section with manifesto on standardization and reproducibility]

Include/emphasize why this is a good way compared with their usual way - same as others (standardized)

- Different techniques/levels of QAQC e.g., with different PIs, software, project needs etc.. These steps standardize across these different datasets.

[Burba, 2021; notes] 
Reasons:
* Ensures bad data is filtered out: bad due to instrument malfunction, processing/mathematical artifacts, ambient conditions not satisfying the eddy covariance method (non-stationary conditions, divergence/convergence), winds are not from the footprint of interest, and heavy precipitation
