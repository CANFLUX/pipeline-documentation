## Software Overview and Current Recommended Versions

All three stages of data cleaning can be run from **Matlab** [link to Install_Matlab.md]. 

Note that the third stage Matlab script invokes an **R**-script, which you will also need installed on your local computer [link to R/RStudio installation instructions]. 

The scripts and tools that run the data cleaning are kept in a **Git** repository [link to Clone_Biomet_Library.md]. 

Optionally, you can install Git and create your own **Github** account [link to Install_Git_Create_Account_Optional.md]. 

Some users may also need **Python** installed [link to Install_Python.md].

#### Recommended Software Versions:

Updated on blah 2024 (XXX update!)

* As of March 2024 we recommend using Matlab version 2023b (2024a?) so that functionality is transferable across all platforms. 
* As of May 2024 we recommend R v4.3.3 and RStudio version XXX.
* Python version 3.9.6 for Mac, default as of 3 February 2024 (is this the best one, also what is Python needed for?)
* Git version??

Your computer/system administrators should be able to help you with all these installations if necessary.
