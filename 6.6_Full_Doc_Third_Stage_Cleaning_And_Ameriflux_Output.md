## 6.6. &nbsp; Quick Start: Third Stage Cleaning and Converting to Ameriflux Output

[XXX In Progress]

Once you have set up the relevant configuration files and your third stage INI, test it using the following Matlab command:
`fr_automated_cleaning(yearIn,siteID,[1 2 7])`.

Alternatively, if you already ran the first and second stages, you can simply run: `fr_automated_cleaning(yearIn,siteID,7)`. Note that the third stage is typically more computationally expensive than stages one and two.

#### *Output to Ameriflux CSV file*
Finally, once you have inspected your clean data and are happy with your INI files, you can output the data to a CSV file formatted for submission to Ameriflux:
`fr_automated_cleaning(yearIn,SITEID,[1 2 7 8])`.

In case you do not want/need to rerun the cleaning (the third stage can be computationally expensive), simply:
`fr_automated_cleaning(yearIn,SITEID,8)`.
