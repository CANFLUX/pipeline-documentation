## 6.4. &nbsp; Full Documentation: Create your First Stage INI File for Data Cleaning 

[XXX In Progress]

#### *Second Stage INI file*

The steps to create your second stage INI are very similar to the first stage:
* Duplicate the `DSM_SecondStage.ini` file you obtained then rename it with your unique measurement site ID, e.g., `MySITEID_SecondStage.ini` (you should have already completed this step [XXX link to Obtain_Sample_Config_Standardization_Files.md]).
* Edit second stage INI file adding *just a few variables at a time* (as with the first stage) and then testing, so it’s easy to diagnose errors/typos. Pay attention to the output in your Matlab command window, it is informative and highlights any issues and where they occur. Recall the data cleaning principles previously outlined [XXX link to Data_Cleaning_Principles section?] and make sure your traces align with the second stage principles.

#### Second stage main features:
1. Combining multiple sensor measurements into one trace. This can be done in different ways using `calc_avg_trace.m`, which combines two or more traces from the first stage (i.e., already deemed “good” sensor measurements; see section XXX on data cleaning principles). You can also combine these three methods:
 * Averaging multiple sensors to remove variability;
 * Using one sensor as the best (most accurate value) and using the other sensor(s) only to fill in the missing values. A relationship can be created between the “best” sensor and its “replacement” and that relationship can be applied to the “replacement” values to improve the accuracy;
 * Using the sensors from another near-by site to fill in the missing values at the current site.

    Arguments for `calc_avg_trace` function:
    | Field | Description | Type |
    | ----- | ----------- | ---- |
    | tv | input the time vector `clean_tv` that has already been created in the first stage cleaning | n/a|
    | data_in | the name of the trace output from stage one, to be filled or "improved" by combining/averaging with another trace or traces | string uppercase |
    | data_fill | the name of the traces used to average/gap-fill "data_in" trace; these "data_fill" traces must have been included in the first stage | integer |
    | avg_period | |



2. As with the first stage, more complex user-defined processing can be applied to the trace using the “Evaluate” option. User written Matlab functions can be called from this statement. Multiple Matlab statements can be called from within the “Evaluate” string. Some rules for formatting apply here (see the DSM SecondStage ini file for details and examples).

#### Second Stage INI file Properties

| Field      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| **XXX Which of these first six fields are actually used/necessary?**
| Site_name   | Name of the site. Any text can go here.        |
| SiteID      | This is the name attributed to the site in the database (e.g., DSM or BB). |
| input_path  | This can stay blank |
| output_path | The local output path?  **Example says leave blank?** |
| high_level_path | leave blank:{}. It used to indicate Met/Flux, etc.|
| searchPath  | All traces on this path(s) will be loaded up and available in the SecondStage cleaning. Syntax: use 'auto' or use specific folders to limit or to expand the (example: 'Flux\Clean,Met\Clean,Flags\Clean'). When option 'auto' is used, all the traces created by the FirstStage cleaning will be automatically loaded before the SecondStage cleaning starts. |
|[Trace] | Marks the beginning of a new variable. The section has to end with the keyword <[End]>.|
| variableName | Name of variable for second stage, again following Ameriflux format. The variable with the name created here will show up in the `/Database/yyyy/SITEID/Clean/SecondStage` folder, where `yyyy` is the year that the data is valid for. |
| Evaluate | User defined function.  If no function is applied, default input will just pass the variable from the first stage to the second stage, e.g.,  `Evaluate = 'TKE = TKE;'`.  Use the `calc_avg_trace` function (described above) to average or gap-fill met variables (such as air temperature) with values from secondary measurements or nearby sites (you will need to load these into the first stage before using them in this second stage). See sample file `DSM_SecondStage.ini` for more use cases.|
| title | Descriptive variable name for plots/visualization. |
| units | Units for this current trace, e.g. `'W/m^2'`|

Once you have added a few variables to the second stage INI, test it using the following Matlab command:
`fr_automated_cleaning(yearIn,SITEID,[1 2])`
Alternatively, if you already ran the first stage, you can simply run:
`fr_automated_cleaning(yearIn,SITEID,2)`.

**Note for first and second stage:** [XXX not sure if this belongs here or elsewhere] Here are some programming rules that you must follow for the INI files to be successfully read by the pipeline scripts:
```
Programming Syntax Rules for First and Second stage INI files:

1. We enforce using uppercase for site IDs to avoid problems between running data cleaning on Mac vs. Windows.
2. All traces must be enclosed in [Trace] and [End] blocks.
3. All assignments can be on multiple lines, but should be enclosed in single quotes.
4. Comments must begin with a percentage sign (%).
5. All fields must be in Matlab format.
6. All parameter assignments must be to strings in single quotes, or numeric expressions, e.g., threshold_const = 6, threshold_const = [6], variableName = 'Some Name'.
7. For the first stage, the partial path must be included with the inputFileName when you locate the raw data trace in the database. (Using biomet_path function only returns the path: /year/SITEID/measType/)
8. First stage necessary fields are: variableName, inputFileName, measurementType, units, title, and minMax.
9. Second stage necessary fields are: variableName, title, units.
