## Install Matlab on your local computer

Currently, Matlab is necessary to run the data cleaning scripts. 

* First, check which Matlab version is currently recommended for the pipeline code [link to Software_Overview_Current_Recommended_Versions.md]. This is important so that all the pipeline code runs correctly. 

* Visit [this website](https://www.mathworks.com/help/install/ug/install-products-with-internet-connection.html) for details on how to install Matlab, or contact your systems administrator for help. 

* Make sure you install Matlab with the following toolboxes only:
a. Signal Processing
b. Curve fitting
c. Statistics and Machine Learning
d. Optimization
e. Global Optimization
f. If you see something else that you may want to try, go for it (Neural Networks,…) but having all the toolboxes installed is a waste of your disk space.

* If you already have the correct version of Matlab on your local computer, you can install the necessary toolboxes using the “Add-Ons” button in the “Home” tab within Matlab (or use the “Add-Ons” button to get additional toolboxes down the line).


Note: you can have more than one version of Matlab on your computer in case you prefer to use another version of Matlab for other projects.
